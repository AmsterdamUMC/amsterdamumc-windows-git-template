Overview and explaination of the files in the RS-project template

Data directory

Consider very carefully where you place your data-files. Certain files contain sensitive information
such as patient information, secrets used to access web-services, output files such as logs.
It is considered good practice to place all these files under the 'data' directory. This 
directory is ignored by Git in order to reduce the chance that you accidentally commit
this type of data. 

Pre-commit checks implemented


The following notes can be issued from the pre-commit check. The notes are alway preceeded by
two angular braces: '>>' 
1) >> NOTE: .gitignore not present
	TODO add explaination
